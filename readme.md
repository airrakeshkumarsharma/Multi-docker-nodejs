# DevOps Project - Deploying a Scalable Web Application

This project involves building a simple web application, dockerizing it, and deploying it on AWS using a range of DevOps tools.

- [x] **Step 1: Develop a Simple Web Application**
    - [x] Set up a simple web application (for example, a Node.js Express app or a Flask Python app).
    - [x] Store the application in a GitHub repository.

- [x] **Step 2: Dockerize Your Application**
    - [x] Write a Dockerfile for your application.
    - [x] Build the Dockerfile and run it locally to ensure it works correctly.

- [x] **Step 3: Use Docker Compose**
    - [x] Define your application's services using Docker Compose (for example, a web service and a database service).

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement Nginx as a Reverse Proxy**
    - [ ] Use Nginx to manage your application's incoming traffic.
    - [ ] Configure Nginx to direct traffic to your application running in the Docker container.

- [ ] **Step 5: Set Up CI/CD with GitHub Actions**
    - [ ] Create a workflow for GitHub Actions to build your Docker images and push them to Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry when changes are pushed to the main branch.

- [ ] **Step 6: Deploy Your Application on AWS EC2**
    - [ ] Set up an EC2 instance.
    - [ ] Install Docker and Docker Compose on the EC2 instance and run your application.

- [ ] **Step 7: Scale Your Application with AWS EKS**
    - [ ] Set up AWS EKS with EC2 instances.
    - [ ] Migrate your application to the Kubernetes-based system by creating Docker images for your application and database, setting up a Kubernetes cluster, creating deployments, and exposing your application via a service.

- [ ] **Step 8: Monitoring and Logging**
    - [ ] Set up monitoring and logging for your application, for example, using AWS CloudWatch or any other preferred tool.

Remember to take it step by step and enjoy the learning process!
